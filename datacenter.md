E.DataCenter.2b:

The Switch SuperNAP held the title of largest data center in the world for quite some time, boasting 3.5 million square feet.
It is located in Las Vegas, Nevada. This can run yearly capacity of the 587914  MWatts. The data center features a calculated
annualized Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) of 1.28 . These data points (reference below) combined with Schnider Electric Data
Center Carbon Footprint Calculator, Yearly Cost, Yearly CO2 and Yearly Equivalent CO2 in cars could be computed.

I have calculated my footprint using http://carbonfootprint.c2es.org/ calculator based on where I live and what heating
mechanism I use and what I drive.
My footprint is 8304  LBS OF CO2.

Solar energy is a renewable free source of energy that is sustainable and totally inexhaustible, unlike fossil fuels that ar
finite. It is also a non-polluting source of energy and it does not emit any greenhouse gases when producing electricity.
Solar electricity can supplement your entire or partial energy consumption. Using solar power means reducing your energy bills
and saving money.  Low maintenance and unobtrusive, installing solar panels adds value to your home.

Solar and water are the renewal energies I have picked and these are used in the Switch data center as part of green
initiative.

In 2016, Switch began construction of two solar power stations in Las Vegas, Nevada with a combined 179MW of capacity. These
facilities have the ability to
* 		Power all Switch data centers with 100% renewable energy
* 		Remove the equivalent of 50,000 cars off the road
* 		Eliminate 265,000 carbon tons of emission from the environment

Water

Switch also applies sustainability initiatives to protecting the world’s most precious resource: water. Through industry
partnerships, Switch helped pioneer and develop proprietary technology that eliminates chemicals from our cooling systems,
while increasing efficiency by over 400% and saving more than 155 million gallons of water in just 3 years.

India is one of the countries with the largest production of energy from renewable sources.Four of the top seven largest solar
parks worldwide are in India including the second-largest solar park in the world at Kurnool, Andhra Pradesh, with a capacity
of 1000 MW. The world's largest solar power plant Bhadla Solar Park is being constructed in Rajasthan with a capacity of 2255
MW.
